# Implementing different machine learning models to predict heart disease occurence

This is an ongoing project being developed as part of the Zero to Mastery Complete Machine Learning and Data Science Bootcamp. 
The goal is to try out and explore different machine learning models to predict the occurence of heart disease using the Heart Disease UCI dataset. 


## Project description

In this project the following models are used: 
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forest
* Linear SVC

Before modelling, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed, in order to not only better understand the dataset but also to get familiarized with some
data analysis tools. 

Because the project is being developed with education and exploration purposes, some parts of it may be quite redundant, as the goal it to get myself 
familiarized with the tools I used.
